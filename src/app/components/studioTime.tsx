                    This is not a private book, if you wouldn&apos;t want me or a parent to see your picture don&apos;t draw it.</li>
                <li>Take your final design and draw it again on your sketchbook, you know, but nicer.</li>
                <li>Your name should be <strong>highly visible</strong>.</li>
                <li>Take care of this book, always put it back in the bin. You only get one sketchbook!</li>
